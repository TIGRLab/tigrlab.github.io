TIGRLAB Website
---------------

This is a website for the TIGRLab, build on the Skinny Bones Jekyll Theme.

Note for n00bs like me -- you need to clone the gh-pages branch, not the master branch, if you ever want to start from scratch.

Edit \_data/???.yml to change the navigation features of the site.

Note that the 'category' field in the header of each post (under \_/posts) will determine what post type will end up in the kewl grid -- NOT the folder the post falls under (this is more for humans).

Each header / footer entry should have an identically named folder containing an index.md file.

That is all I know right now.
