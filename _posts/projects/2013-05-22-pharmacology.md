The main purpose of this four-site neuroimaging study is to serve as the first-ever placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of antipsychotic medications on brain structure and function. Antipsychotic usage and prescriptions continue to increase in number, and FDA approvals for different populations without a primary psychotic disorder (e.g. mood disorders, the elderly, children) are increasing. Our understanding of the effects of antipsychotics on brain structure, however, is very limited, due to the absence of placebo-controlled investigations. This study should resolve the question of whether antipsychotics are neuroprotective or neurotoxic for brain structure.
