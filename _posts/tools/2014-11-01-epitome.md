We built this to address the needs to fMRI researchers, who often write one-use (but extensive) BASH pipelines ([see the human connectome project for an extreme example](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines)).

Epitome makes use of a a python wrapper ([scriptit](https://github.com/josephdviviano/scriptit)) that pastes together BASH modules to generate a complete and portable pre-processing pipeline.

With only a little BASH knowledge, scientists can extend this ecosystem by writing a properly-formatted scriptit module.
