Survey is available [here](http://tinyurl.com/scancompleted)

We've recently streamlined our notification process by replacing our prior 'scan completed' email with a 'scan completed' survey.

## Optional Customizations

1. Content. The existing survey has the minimal essential information we need. However, we can add to it to better capture whatever you're interested in. For example, you might want a checklist of acquisitions, with the option to enter qualitative notes about participant behaviour, or the reason a particular scan was dropped. Let us know what you'd like and we can add it.

2. Offline access. Wireless access is sometimes spotty in the MRI Centre. If you want to reliably complete the survey live, you can use the REDCap Mobile App for offline data collection on a tablet or cellphone. Your data is synced back to the server when your connection is re-established.

3. Record keeping. You might be keeping overlapping information about your scans for your own records. If so, you don't have to enter it twice - you can have access to the REDCap database underlying the survey, and review/query/export (your own data) from there.

4. Email notifications. Perhaps you want to let your manager or PI know every time a scan is completed, or each time a scan meets certain conditions (e.g., a scan is missing a given acquisition), or send a facsimile of your entire report. Let us know who should be emailed under what circumstances, and we can set up automatic notifications.
