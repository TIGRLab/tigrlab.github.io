Accessing the Database
----------------------

**Web-Based**

[http://da55.pet.utoronto.ca:5004](http://da55.pet.utoronto.ca:5004)

+ Log in using your site's username and password.
+ Click on your project.
+ NOTE: Each site is assigned a numeric code in their project title (e.g., PRE07). This is to keep the uploads from each site seperate to prevent one site from interfering with any of the other sites. However, all participants collected in each study should recieve an identical study code (typically numeric code 01), regarless of the project number. So in this case, you would upload PRE01_ZHH_0023_01_01 to PRE07.

**DICOM Port**

+ DICOM Port: 8104.
+ Calling & Called Title: 'XNAT'.
