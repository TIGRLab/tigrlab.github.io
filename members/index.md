</figure>

Dr. Aristotle Voineskos (MD, University of Toronto; PhD, University of Toronto) is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Vice President of Research at CAMH and Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’ work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’ work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He also uses brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Nicholas Neufeld (MD, University of Toronto; MSc, University College London) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, and Clinician Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). Dr. Neufeld’s research program investigates the neurobiology of severe mental illness across the lifespan and develop biomarkers, with a specific focus on schizophrenia and depression. His research philosophy centres on integrating multi-modal neuroimaging measures within clinical research to develop a comprehensive and impactful understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment trajectories. An example of this work is the Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Schizophrenia – Neurocircuitry (MAST-Neuro) study funded by a Brain & Behavior Research Foundation NARSAD Young Investigator Award (PI: Nicholas Neufeld). This study is embedded within the MAST-Trial, a federally funded clinical trial that compares electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy for clozapine and non-clozapine treatment augmentation in patients with treatment resistant-schizophrenia. MAST-Neuro aims to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of therapeutic effects and cognitive side effects in the ongoing MAST-Trial. Fundamentally, the MAST-Trial is positioned to lead to an indication for MST as a next-generation therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, thereby increasing the number of therapeutic options available to the most severely ill patients with schizophrenia. MAST-Neuro is poised to improve our mechanistic understanding of the risks and benefits of this novel brain stimulation intervention and bring the field one step closer to personalized medicine.

Depression is known to be a significant risk factor for conversion from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and from MCI to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).  The pathways affected by depression and dementia are thought to overlap; however, evidence linking the two is tenuous.  At the Kimel lab at CAMH, I am exploring how depression affects grey and white matter microstructure across the spectrum of healthy aging to dementia using multi-shell DWI acquisitions. We hope that by identifying common pathways underlying depression and dementia, we can identify individuals at-risk for dementia earlier, and perhaps prevent conversion by treating the depressive symptoms.

Lauren Liu
----------

Lauren Liu (BEng Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, expected 2019) joined the lab as a summer student. In collaboration with Joseph Viviano, Liu analyzed the relationships between structural topology and brain dynamics at rest, among participants with schizophrenia and healthy control populations. She tested various diffusion tractography algorithms and parameters in order to tackle the challenge of quantifying structural connectivity strength between brain regions. Liu subsequently developed a processing pipeline to produce ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices for various structural metrics to use in conjunction with functional MRI correlation matrices, which will soon be adopted into the lab’s larger processing pipelines system. Combining multimodal neuroimaging techniques - in this case structural and functional - allows for a more comprehensive characterization of global brain networks, an essential first step to future interventions.

Dayton Miranda
--------------

Dayton Miranda (BSc Life Sciences, Western University, expected 2020) returned as a summer student for the second year. In collaboration with Dr. Erin Dickie and Saba Sahab, Miranda analyzed structural and functional MRI data from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls in an effort to identify between-group structural differences in the cortex, which in turn might contribute to an explanation of the functional disconnectivity observed in schizophrenia. Further understanding of the structural features and markers of schizophrenia might allow the illness to be identified and perhaps predicted using structural as opposed to functional scans, which are quicker and therefore cheaper to collect. Miranda is continuing to analyze incoming data for this project, and looks forward to reporting his results in an upcoming paper.


Laagi Yoganathan
----------------

Laagi Yoganathan (BSc Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University) returned as a summer student for the second year. Under the supervision of Drs.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.

Dr. Chakravarty now heads the [CoBrA Lab](https://cobralab.ca/) at the [Douglas Institute, Montreal](https://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en).
