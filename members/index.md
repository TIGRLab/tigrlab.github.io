Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

</figure>

Melissa did a BSc in Psychology at McGill University, followed by an MSc in Neuroscience, also at McGill. During her Master’s degree she studied the function of the serotonin 1A receptor following acute administration of fluoxetine, using positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]MPPF in healthy populations of both rats and humans. Then, during her PhD in Biomedical Sciences in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Montreal, she studied the long-term impacts of prenatal and early postnatal adversity on brain development using MRI and fMRI, and epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, in a cohort of adolescent monozygotic twins followed since birth. 

At CAMH, she is now working on testing the accelerated aging hypothesis of schizophrenia using both DTI and peripheral markers in young and old schizophrenia patients and controls. Her interests lie in uncovering the biomarkers of vulnerability for mental illness using a combination of neuroimaging and molecular strategies.

Daniel Felsky, M.Sc

</figure>

My active studies are primarily focused on both the independent effects of multiple Alzheimer’s risk genes as well as the way in which genetic risk factors may interact to influence brain susceptibility for dementia. I am currently involved in a collaborative study of structural brain changes due to mutations in a gene involved in brain inflammation (called TSPO), and have found that a single variant within this gene may confer protection against the development of Alzheimer’s-associated brain pathology that is roughly equivalent to a six-year reduction in age. Importantly, this study has implications for characterizing the genetic roots of other complex mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis) that are also known to have immunological components. These studies are in collaboration with field-leading scientists at Rush University in Chicago, Il (Dr. David Bennett), and Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA (Dr. Philip L. De Jager).

Building on work I have completed during my graduate training, I will be pursuing additional investigations of genes that may predict depressive symptoms (which are highly prevalent in late-life dementia), as well as cognitive decline in younger individuals with schizophrenia. I expect that my future work on the interactive relationships between risk genes in disease-related pathways, as well the as effect of lifestyle and environment on the activity of these pathways, will yield a new understanding of why and how diseases such as Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia develop, leading to novel biologically-informed and individually-tailored intervention strategies.

My plan as a researcher is to pursue post-doctoral training following the defence of my PhD, as I believe that the accelerating pace of mental health research, facilitated largely by the availability of new collaborative large-scale datasets, promises many exciting breakthroughs in the coming years. My ambition is to make critical contributions to this progress by expanding our knowledge of genetic systems, brain structure, and early risk for cognitive decline, with the ultimate goal of nullifying the growing burden of mental illness in Canada and around the world.

Julie is a student in the second year of her Master's degree with the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her thesis focuses on comparing machine learning techniques reported in the magnetic resonance imaging literature for schizophrenia/control classification. Her previous work includes atlasing the hippocampus on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Julie has been with the Kimel Family lab group since 2012. In her spare time, she can be found baking delicious treats, eating said baking, or out rowing on Lake Ontario.

I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. 

On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.

I function as both a system administrator and methods developer at the TIGRlab. I get excited about cross-disiplinary work that can be adapted to improve clinical outcomes. I'm particularly interested in ways of using dynamic network models to quantify the differences between diseased and normally-functioning brains, and using this approach to develop novel disease subtypes that should provide important information for the application of personalizeed treatments.

I am a research analyst with the Kimel Family Translational Imaging Genetics lab and the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention.  Currently I coordinate a clinical trial exploring the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of working memory deficits in schizophrenia and effects on brain structure and function (funded by CIHR).  My previous work focused on examining neurocognitive variance in functioning in schizophrenia using eye tracking technology. I am very passionate about understanding the role of neurocognitive impairments in psychosis and the potential for brain stimulation as a treatment to improve quality of life in clients with mood and psychotic disorders.


Mikko Mason, B.Sc

As a relatively new member of the Kimel Lab, I am excited to work with so many bright, engaged individuals. My role as a study RA challenges me to apply my psychometric experience to a research setting, and I am constantly amazed by the resilience with which our patients meet mental health challenges. I plan to further my education and combine research, clinical work, and teaching in the future. 

On a more personal level, I feel like a Finn when in Canada and a Canadian when in Finland. I have a soft spot for old novels and the CBC. I believe in free time the way I believe in unicorns, but find sanctuary in wild places. I am happiest in woods or water or on a bike.

Dr. Mallar Chakravarty, Ph.D
----------------------------
<figure>
	<a href="/images/mallar.chakravarty.img.jpg"><img src="/images/mallar.chakravarty.img.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.

Dr. Chakravarty now heads the [CoBrA Lab](http://cobralab.ca/) at the [Douglas Institute, Montreal](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en).
