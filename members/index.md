</figure>

Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Dr. Hawco (PhD, Neuroscience, McGill University) is a project scientist. He develops new approaches to uncover meaningful patterns of individual variability in complex neuroimaging data. He hopes this work will lead to better understanding of biological variability in patient samples, and inform personalized medicine approaches in psychiatry. In 2018, Dr. Hawco was appointed to the Department of Psychiatry as an Assistant Professor, published six papers (four as first author) and four conference poster presentations. Dr. Hawco has also submitted his first large project grants as senior investigator to CIHR and the National Institute of Mental Health, developing neuroimaging markers to predict response to brain stimulation therapies.

</figure>

Dr. Erin Dickie (PhD, Neurological Sciences, McGill University) is a Project Scientist. Dr. Dickie’s research focus is personalized connectomics, or the ability to map brain organization at the level of the individual. She recently published a paper in Biological Psychiatry, finding that personalized brain mapping might facilitate biomarker discovery. In this paper, she introduced a novel tool for mapping neurodiversity (PINT), and showed that the brains of those affected by autism are more variable in their organization than those of typically developing controls. Dr. Dickie was recently awarded a NARSAD Young Investigator Award to investigate how individual mapping of brain function may be a critical first step for the design of targets for neurostimulation therapy. Dr. Dickie also founded the “ciftify” open software framework for surface-based analyses of MR data, with collaboration from the developers of the Human Connectome Project. She serves as an invited instructor and member in international initiatives for education and best scientific practices, including the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) working group for Reproducibility and Best Practices in Human Brain Imaging.



Dr. Lindsay Oliver, Ph.D
------------------------
<figure>
        <a href="/images/ppl.l.oliver.jpg"><img src="/images/ppl.l.oliver.jpeg"></a>
</figure>

Dr. Lindsay Oliver (PhD, Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario) is a postdoctoral fellow. Oliver’s work focuses on the neural circuitry and behavioural correlates of social cognition across psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Oliver is currently using behavioural modeling to examine the structure of social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls from the SPINS dataset. Her recently published work used structural equation modeling to identify lower-level (e.g., emotion recognition) and higher-level (e.g., inferring others' intentions) social abilities. Oliver revealed an association between these higher-level abilities and everyday functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorder and healthy control groups. Now, Dr. Oliver is incorporating brain imaging data to understand neural networks underlying social cognitive deficits. The overall goal is to identify biomarkers of social cognitive impairment to inform targeted treatment options for these symptoms.

Dr. Schifani (PhD, Neuroscience, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg) joined the lab in September 2018. She will be using advanced MRI techniques to work with data from the rTMS-WM study. Schifani’s work will first explore the impact of rTMS on the structure of the cortex, using a cutting-edge method called Neuritic Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). Next, Schifani intends to explore how rTMS changes the functional brain networks underlying working memory function. With this, we aim to improve understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of rTMS.  Data collection for rTMS-WM is almost completed, and analyses will begin shortly.


Dr. John Anderson, Ph.D
-----------------------------
<figure>
        <a href="/images/ppl.j.anderson.jpg"><img src="/images/ppl.j.anderson.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Depression is known to be a significant risk factor for conversion from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and from MCI to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).  The pathways affected by depression and dementia are thought to overlap; however, evidence linking the two is tenuous.  At the Kimel lab at CAMH, I am exploring how depression affects grey and white matter microstructure across the spectrum of healthy aging to dementia using multi-shell DWI acquisitions. We hope that by identifying common pathways underlying depression and dementia, we can identify individuals at-risk for dementia earlier, and perhaps prevent conversion by treating the depressive symptoms.

Dr. Forde (BSc Chemistry, University College Cork, Ireland; MSc Neuropharmacology, National University of Ireland, Galway; PhD Psychiatry, University of Groningen, the Netherlands) joined the lab in January 2018 as a post-doctoral research fellow. Dr. Forde is interested in symptoms that appear across different neurodevelopmental disorders and investigates their neural correlates by integrating imaging data from multiple modalities. She uses this multi-modal approach to better understand brain connectivity, the relationship between brain structure and function, and the way this all relates to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Forde uses the uniquely large Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network dataset of children and adolescents with various neurodevelopmental disorders to identify biomarkers that relate to symptoms across disorders. In the future, this may help design targeted interventions like transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve cross disorder symptoms and long-term outcomes for those with neurodevelopmental disorders. Dr. Forde was awarded a CAMH Discovery Fund award for this proposal.

</figure>

Lauren Liu (BEng Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, expected 2019) joined the lab as a summer student. In collaboration with Joseph Viviano, Liu analyzed the relationships between structural topology and brain dynamics at rest, among participants with schizophrenia and healthy control populations. She tested various diffusion tractography algorithms and parameters in order to tackle the challenge of quantifying structural connectivity strength between brain regions. Liu subsequently developed a processing pipeline to produce ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices for various structural metrics to use in conjunction with functional MRI correlation matrices, which will soon be adopted into the lab’s larger processing pipelines system. Combining multimodal neuroimaging techniques - in this case structural and functional - allows for a more comprehensive characterization of global brain networks, an essential first step to future interventions.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.

Dr. Chakravarty now heads the [CoBrA Lab](http://cobralab.ca/) at the [Douglas Institute, Montreal](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en).

Melissa did a BSc in Psychology at McGill University, followed by an MSc in Neuroscience, also at McGill. During her Master’s degree she studied the function of the serotonin 1A receptor following acute administration of fluoxetine, using positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]MPPF in healthy populations of both rats and humans. Then, during her PhD in Biomedical Sciences in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Montreal, she studied the long-term impacts of prenatal and early postnatal adversity on brain development using MRI and fMRI, and epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, in a cohort of adolescent monozygotic twins followed since birth.

At CAMH, she is now working on testing the accelerated aging hypothesis of schizophrenia using both DTI and peripheral markers in young and old schizophrenia patients and controls. Her interests lie in uncovering the biomarkers of vulnerability for mental illness using a combination of neuroimaging and molecular strategies.

Amy Miles (BA, Psychology & French Language and Literature, University of Maryland; MA Developmental Psychology, Columbia) is a fifth year PhD candidate under the supervision of Drs. Allan Kaplan and Aristotle Voineskos. She is interested in the neurobiological underpinnings and developmental trajectories of eating disorders and has designed a structural MRI study to explore the neuroanatomical correlates of risk for and manifestation of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Ultimately, Amy hopes to use this information to identify novel therapeutic targets for AN, the most fatal psychiatric disorder and one for which there are currently no evidence-based treatments.
