Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Nick is a psychiatry resident with research interests in stroke and stroke recovery, neurocognitive disorders, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and transdiagnostic approaches to psychotic disorders. He’s particularly interested in the use of neuroimaging in the context of brain stimulation for basic neuroscience and translational studies.

Julie is a student in the second year of her Master's degree with the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her thesis focuses on comparing machine learning techniques reported in the magnetic resonance imaging literature for schizophrenia/control classification. Her previous work includes atlasing the hippocampus on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Julie has been with the Kimel Family lab group since 2012. In her spare time, she can be found baking delicious treats, eating said baking, or out rowing on Lake Ontario.

I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. 

On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.

Joseph Viviano, M.Sc

I function as both a system administrator and methods developer at the TIGRlab. I get excited about cross-disiplinary work that can be adapted to improve clinical outcomes. I'm particularly interested in ways of using dynamic network models to quantify the differences between diseased and normally-functioning brains, and using this approach to develop novel disease subtypes that should provide important information for the application of personalizeed treatments.

Dr. Mallar Chakravarty, Ph.D
----------------------------
<figure>
	<a href="/images/mallar.chakravarty.img.jpg"><img src="/images/mallar.chakravarty.img.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.

Dr. Chakravarty now heads the [CoBrA Lab](http://cobralab.ca/) at the [Douglas Institute, Montreal](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en).
