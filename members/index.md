Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Dr. Erin Dickie (PhD, Neurological Sciences, McGill University) is a Project Scientist. Dr. Dickie’s research focus is personalized connectomics, or the ability to map brain organization at the level of the individual. Individual mapping of brain function may be a critical first step in the design of targets for stimulation therapy. Dr. Dickie recently submitted a manuscript describing her tool for mapping neurodiversity (PINT), and showed that the brains of those affected by autism and more variable in their organization that those of typically developing controls. This work suggests that personalized brain mapping might be a critical first step for future biomarker discovery. Dr. Dickie also assists with the lab’s data management and analysis system, and builds automated tools for data analysis. In the past year, she has developed a new tool for surface-based analyses (ciftify) that has been publicly available and adopted by international groups.

Dr. Lindsay Oliver (BSc, Neuroscience, University of Toronto; MSc, Human Cognitive Neuropsychology, University of Edinburgh; PhD, Neuroscience, University of Western Ontario) recently joined the lab as a postdoctoral fellow. Oliver’s work focuses on the neural circuitry and behavioural correlates of social cognition across psychiatric and neurologic disorders. Oliver is currently using behavioural modeling to examine the structure of social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls from the SPINS dataset. The goal is to determine whether lower-level (emotion recognition) and higher-level (inferring what someone else is thinking or feeling) social abilities are differentiable, and how they relate to symptom severity and every-day functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Going forward, Oliver hopes to identify biomarkers of social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia to inform intervention and targeted treatment options for these debilitating symptoms.

</figure>

Lauren Liu (BEng Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, McMaster University, expected 2019) joined the lab as a summer student. In collaboration with Joseph Viviano, Liu analyzed the relationships between structural topology and brain dynamics at rest, among participants with schizophrenia and healthy control populations. She tested various diffusion tractography algorithms and parameters in order to tackle the challenge of quantifying structural connectivity strength between brain regions. Liu subsequently developed a processing pipeline to produce ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices for various structural metrics to use in conjunction with functional MRI correlation matrices, which will soon be adopted into the lab’s larger processing pipelines system. Combining multimodal neuroimaging techniques - in this case structural and functional - allows for a more comprehensive characterization of global brain networks, an essential first step to future interventions.

Dayton Miranda

Dayton Miranda (BSc Life Sciences, Western University, expected 2020) returned as a summer student for the second year. In collaboration with Dr. Erin Dickie and Saba Sahab, Miranda analyzed structural and functional MRI data from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls in an effort to identify between-group structural differences in the cortex, which in turn might contribute to an explanation of the functional disconnectivity observed in schizophrenia. Further understanding of the structural features and markers of schizophrenia might allow the illness to be identified and perhaps predicted using structural as opposed to functional scans, which are quicker and therefore cheaper to collect. Miranda is continuing to analyze incoming data for this project, and looks forward to reporting his results in an upcoming paper.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.
