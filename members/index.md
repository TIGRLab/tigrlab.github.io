Dr. Aristotle Voineskos, M.D., Ph.D

Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Julie is a student in the second year of her Master's degree with the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her thesis focuses on comparing machine learning techniques reported in the magnetic resonance imaging literature for schizophrenia/control classification. Her previous work includes atlasing the hippocampus on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Julie has been with the Kimel Family lab group since 2012. In her spare time, she can be found baking delicious treats, eating said baking, or out rowing on Lake Ontario.

I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. 

On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.

Joseph Viviano, M.Sc

I get excited about the interdisciplinary themes in science and the links between these academic pursuits and real-world problems. Diverse complex systems have similar organizations: ant colonies provide insight into the workings of the mind, the climate helps us understand the prerequisites for a healthy economy, and market research techniques help us understand how to predict disease.

I'm particularly interested in the commonalities of network structures across systems, and the transfer of information between model systems of vastly different scales. Most scientific enterprises are plagued by a problem of scale: instrumentation limitations often restrict fields of study to very specific resolutions of analysis. Recent advances in the studies of complex systems suggest that, regardless of the participants, systems of significant scale all behave in roughly similar ways. If this proves to be true, the transfer of findings across technical disciplines could revolutionize every field integral to modern society. I'm interested in contributing to this cause, and using these models to designing better systems and techniques for manipulating these systems. Further, I'm interested in developing tools can robustly classify these systems in common states or types, with a focus on the messy signals we typically obtain from biological systems.
