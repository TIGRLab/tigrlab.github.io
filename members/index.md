Dr. Aristotle Voineskos, M.D., Ph.D
-----------------------------------
<figure>

</figure>

Dr. Aristotle Voineskos is the Koerner New Scientist, and Head of the Kimel-Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory at CAMH. He is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Dr. Voineskos’s work combines multi-modal neuroimaging and genetics approaches to map gene effects in the brain with a view to discovering vulnerability pathways for severe mental illness. This will aid in early identification of at-risk individuals and disease prevention. Currently, his neuroimaging approaches include MRI techniques known as diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness mapping. Disease populations currently under study include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as studying healthy individuals and healthy aging.

Another area of Dr. Voineskos’s work includes understanding genetic and structural brain determinants of brain function by combining the approaches described above with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). He is also using brain imaging to understand the effects of existing and novel treatments on brain structure and function.

Dr. Colin Hawko, Ph.D

Colin is a Post-doctoral fellow working with both the Kimmel lab and the Temerity Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention with Dr. Jeff Daskalakis. His research speciality is cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroimaging. In the TIGR lab, Colin has been examining relationships between social cognitive abilities and fMRI task activity using a partial least squares approach. Patients with schizophrenia have a noted deficit in social cognition (such as understanding sarcasm, or reading the intentions and emotions of others) which is strongly tied to functional outcomes such as independent living and employment status. We hope to identify neural networks which are related to social cognitive ability, and understand how some of these networks may be disrupted with problems in this area. Such neural networks may provide targets for novel intervention approaches. Additionally, Colin is very interested in neural stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As such, he is also involved in an ongoing clinical trial using TMS to improve working memory in schizophrenia, as well as a project involving the use of concurrent TMS and fMRI to probe network connectivity during working memory in people with or without schizophrenia.

Melissa did a BSc in Psychology at McGill University, followed by an MSc in Neuroscience, also at McGill. During her Master’s degree she studied the function of the serotonin 1A receptor following acute administration of fluoxetine, using positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]MPPF in healthy populations of both rats and humans. Then, during her PhD in Biomedical Sciences in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Montreal, she studied the long-term impacts of prenatal and early postnatal adversity on brain development using MRI and fMRI, and epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, in a cohort of adolescent monozygotic twins followed since birth.

At CAMH, she is now working on testing the accelerated aging hypothesis of schizophrenia using both DTI and peripheral markers in young and old schizophrenia patients and controls. Her interests lie in uncovering the biomarkers of vulnerability for mental illness using a combination of neuroimaging and molecular strategies.

I am a MSc student under the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto.  My research has a transdiagnostic focus and explores social cognitive deficits in youth and young adults with schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorder.  I am driven to uncover neurobiological correlates of social cognition in order to inform innovative biologically-driven interventions to put more young people on a path to recovery.

The most significant accomplishments of my previous work include coordinating a clinical trial at CAMH exploring the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of working memory deficits in schizophrenia (funded by CIHR) and a study examining neurocognitive variance in functioning in schizophrenia using eye tracking technology at Queen's University.

Amy is a third year PhD student at the Institute for Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto. Under the supervision of Drs. Allan Kaplan and Aristotle Voineskos, she is exploring the neural correlates of Anorexia Nervosa across underweight and weight-recovered subjects and their unaffected sisters. Inclusion of groups with either shared lifetime disease history or shared genetics may provide insight into and/or help differentiate between the transient effects of acute malnutrition and potential premorbid vulnerabilities.

In her spare time, Amy enjoys watching SportsCentre (the real one, not this silly Canadian rip off) and playing with cats.\

Daniel Felsky, M.Sc
-------------------

</figure>

My active studies are primarily focused on both the independent effects of multiple Alzheimer’s risk genes as well as the way in which genetic risk factors may interact to influence brain susceptibility for dementia. I am currently involved in a collaborative study of structural brain changes due to mutations in a gene involved in brain inflammation (called TSPO), and have found that a single variant within this gene may confer protection against the development of Alzheimer’s-associated brain pathology that is roughly equivalent to a six-year reduction in age. Importantly, this study has implications for characterizing the genetic roots of other complex mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis) that are also known to have immunological components. These studies are in collaboration with field-leading scientists at Rush University in Chicago, Il (Dr. David Bennett), and Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA (Dr. Philip L. De Jager).

Building on work I have completed during my graduate training, I will be pursuing additional investigations of genes that may predict depressive symptoms (which are highly prevalent in late-life dementia), as well as cognitive decline in younger individuals with schizophrenia. I expect that my future work on the interactive relationships between risk genes in disease-related pathways, as well the as effect of lifestyle and environment on the activity of these pathways, will yield a new understanding of why and how diseases such as Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia develop, leading to novel biologically-informed and individually-tailored intervention strategies.

My plan as a researcher is to pursue post-doctoral training following the defense of my PhD, as I believe that the accelerating pace of mental health research, facilitated largely by the availability of new collaborative large-scale datasets, promises many exciting breakthroughs in the coming years. My ambition is to make critical contributions to this progress by expanding our knowledge of genetic systems, brain structure, and early risk for cognitive decline, with the ultimate goal of nullifying the growing burden of mental illness in Canada and around the world.

I function as a system administrator, data analyst, and methods developer at the TIGRlab. On the systems front, I spend most of my time working on ways of efficiently managing multi-site imaging data for basic research and clinical trials, and standardizing their analysis to facilitate reproducibility. I also support the ongoing projects led by other researchers. On the scientific side, I get excited about importing concepts and methods from other scientific frontiers to improve clinical outcomes. Right now I'm particularly interested in developing ways to understand the short-term dynamics of brain network function in diseased and normally-functioning brains. I'm also interested in using this and other approaches to develop novel disease subtypes that may inform personalized treatments.

Dr. Mallar Chakravarty, Ph.D
----------------------------
<figure>
	<a href="/images/ppl.m.chakravarty.jpg"><img src="/images/ppl.m.chakravarty.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tools of choice for the analysis of the brain in normally functioning and diseased states. Different MRI acquisition protocols provide excellent contrast and resolution and can be analyzed using automated techniques. The goal of Dr. Chakravarty’s work is to develop and use computational neuroanatomical techniques to understand how the structure of the brain is altered in psychiatric disorders. These techniques include the automated identification of structures and computational metrics that quantify their shape.  He is currently working on adding information from diffusion tensor imaging in order to describe inter-structural connectivity.  Many of these techniques can be used to elucidate phenotypes that can help describe how known risk genes may be affecting brain anatomy and ultimately increasing susceptibility to psychiatric illness.  This work will aid in the early identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing severe forms of mental illness.

Dr. Chakravarty now heads the [CoBrA Lab](http://cobralab.ca/) at the [Douglas Institute, Montreal](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en).

As a relatively new member of the Kimel Lab, I am excited to work with so many bright, engaged individuals. My role as a study RA challenges me to apply my psychometric experience to a research setting, and I am constantly amazed by the resilience with which our patients meet mental health challenges. I plan to further my education and combine research, clinical work, and teaching in the future.

On a more personal level, I feel like a Finn when in Canada and a Canadian when in Finland. I have a soft spot for old novels and the CBC. I believe in free time the way I believe in unicorns, but find sanctuary in wild places. I am happiest in woods or water or on a bike.
