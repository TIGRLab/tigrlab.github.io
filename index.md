  <h2 class="post-title">Neuroimaging &amp; Genetics</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Our major aim is to combine brain imaging and genetics in order to understand how genes influence brain structure and brain function. Ourneuroimaging techniques include diffusion tensor imaging, which maps the white matter pathways of the brain, functional neuroimaging, which maps brain metabolism in real time, cortical thickness mapping, surface area, and subcortical morphometry which collectively provide sophisticated analysis of gray matter morphology.</p>

  <p class="post-excerpt">By using the imaging-genetics approach in both healthy controls and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), we can move closer to answering how genes confer risk in the brain for psychiatric symptoms and changes in cognitive function. We are studying individuals across the lifespan, as we have a particular interest in age-related brain change, and how genes can influence trajectories of healthy brain aging and resilience compared to pathological aging (e.g. Alzheimerâ€™s disease). Finally, we are also combining brain stimulation approaches with brain imaging to understand how the brain can change itself.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Data Management &amp; Analysis Expertise</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">We are also experts in the management and analysis of multi-site imaging data. Our team has created multiple novel software packages for the quality control and analysis of neuroimaging data. Furthermore, we built and maintain a neuroimaging database system that is quickly becoming the standard model for imaging data management at our hospital.</p>
