The major aim of the Kimel Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory is to combine brain imaging and genetics in order to understand how genes influence brain structure and brain function. Our major neuroimaging techniques include diffusion tensor imaging, which maps the white matter pathways of the brain, cortical thickness mapping, surface area, and subcortical morphometry which collectively provide sophisticated analysis of gray matter morphology. By using the imaging-genetics approach in both healthy controls and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), we can move closer to answering how genes confer risk in the brain for psychiatric symptoms and changes in cognitive function. We are studying individuals across the lifespan, as we have a particular interest in age-related brain change, and how genes can influence trajectories of healthy brain aging and resilience compared to pathological aging (e.g. Alzheimerâ€™s disease). Finally, we are also combining brain stimulation approaches with brain imaging to understand how the brain can change itself.
